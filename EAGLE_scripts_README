This is the documentation for the WRF simulations run for the
EAGLE project (PI Joe Grim, and James Pinto and Anders Jensen) 

0) WPS shoud be run. Note that the intermediate files already exist, 
   so geogrid.exe and metgrid.exe were run manually.

1) run_real.sh YYYY (where YYYY is a year input by user)

This script divides a year into 30 day intervals so that wrf can be run
at those 30 day intervals and not exceed the 12-h Cheyenne wall clock limit.
NOTE: CONFIGURE/COMPILE WRF TO RUN WITH NO LEAP!
This script exports the beginning and end time for each 30 day block
to the cheyenne_real_submit script

2) cheyenne_real_submit

This script is automatically run by run_real.sh
This script sets up the directory tree in /glade/scratch/ and 
copies the appropriate files there needed to run WRF including
the aux_var files, the namlist, the microphysics lookup tables, 
and the tslist files. 
This script then creates the appropriate namelist.input based on
the beginning and end times
Finally, real.exe is run

3) run_wrf.sh YYYY (where YYYY is a year input by user)

This script runs wrf for a given year in 30 day time blocks. This
script searchs for SUCCESS COMPLETE WRF in rsl.out.0000 to determine 
when a time block is complete and resubmits the next time block.

4) cheyenne_wrf_submit

This script is automaticaly run by run_wrf.sh
At the beginning of a year-long simulation, this script clobbers the 
SST and TSK values over water to use the GHRSST values. This is done
by calling the regrid_wrfinput and regrid_wrflowinp scripts. Next, 
wrf restart files are grabbed if needed and the wrf run directory
files are linked to the run directory. Finally, wrf is run. 
cheyenne_wrf_restart_manual is a manual wrf restart script in case 
things go bonkers.


Important WRF stuff and changes:
0) Make sure the links to the wrf executable and other links are defined appropriately
1) CONFIGURE/COMPILE with NO LEAP. No one likes leap years anyway.
2) The SSTs come from the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST)
3) The Noah MP script is updated to be southern hemisphere only.
   This fixes an issue caused by the domain crossing the equator and variables like
   LAI being half a year apart seasonally, e.g. January in the northern hemisphere 
   part of the domain and everything dead, July in the southern hemisphere part of 
   the domain and every green. 
4) A 4-point interpolation is used for the met_em variable RH to keep it positive
   in dry conditions
5) The Kain-Fritsch scheme had issues with low relative humidity values near the surface
   (see point 4 above.) and would sometimes stop if qv<0. This check is bypassed to
   keep things running.
6) RRTMG greenhouse gas values were updated (both LW and SW) for the mid-century
   and end-of-century runs. Those files are stored, as
   module_ra_rrtmg_lw.F_2060_values, module_ra_rrtmg_lw.F_2095_values,
   module_ra_rrtmg_sw.F_2060_values, module_ra_rrtmg_sw.F_2095_values
